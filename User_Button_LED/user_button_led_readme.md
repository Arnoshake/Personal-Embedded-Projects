# User Button LED â€“ Introductory STM32 Project

This is a **simple embedded systems project** using the **STM32 Nucleo F302R8** development board. It demonstrates basic functionality of a microcontroller by turning on an LED when the user button is pressed.

The project serves as a "Hello World" for embedded development, confirming that the IDE setup, hardware, and GPIO input/output are functioning correctly. It also showcases proper **use of Git** for version control.

**Key Features:**
- LED responds to user button input.
- Demonstrates basic GPIO operations.
- Tracks all source and configuration files using Git.

**Technologies:**
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32 HAL libraries
- Git for version control

This project represents a foundational embedded system implementation, highlighting both hardware interaction and software management through Git, suitable for documentation in a professional portfolio.
